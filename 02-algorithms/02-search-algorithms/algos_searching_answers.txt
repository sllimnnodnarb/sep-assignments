4.  Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

It depends on whether or not sorting is possible.  If the unsorted collection can be sorted, then binary search would be far quicker, but else, I would use linear search because there is no point to binary search without sorting.


5.  Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

Binary, (expalained above). I would use recursive as it would perform much faster on a collection of a million items.

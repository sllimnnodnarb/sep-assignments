In pseudo-code describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life.


1. Necessity to bathe

present = time.now

def bathing
  if distance_of_time_ago_in_words(present - 24.hours) < 0
    puts "still reasonably clean"
  else
    puts "please bathe yourself"
  end
end



2. Necessity to breathe

present = time.now

def breathing
  if distance_of_time_ago_in_words(present - 10.secs) < 0
    puts "you should be good still"
  else
    puts "please take breath"
  end
end

3. Necessity to eat

present = time.now

def breathing
  if distance_of_time_ago_in_words(present - 40.days) < 0
    puts "you can theoretically stay alive for a while more"
  else
    puts "please eat, or you will die soon"
  end
end

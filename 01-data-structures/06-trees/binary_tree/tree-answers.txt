1. Trees print per the spec.

2. Time comparison between BST and Heap:
    BST = 0.11566 seconds
    Heap = 0.10446 seconds
    Insert:
      BST = 0.39662 seconds
      Heap = 0.19161  seconds
    Find:
      BST = 0.00021 seconds
      Heap = 0.00008 seconds
    Delete:
      BST = 0.00007
      Heap = 0.00006

  Heap is all around a faster method based on performance.  BST is particularly slower at inserting and finding, by about 50%.  It seems that binary search could still be useful in small data structures, or in an instance where you have excess performance capacity.  Regardless it seems that Heap would be the best approach all round.
